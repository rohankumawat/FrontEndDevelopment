                <h2>It's me, a Culer</h2>
                <p>The Catalan side had more fans than their stadium, with a two-tier stand, could comfortably hold. Due to the
                    over-crowding, some fans started sitting on the walls that surrounded the pitch. The first image that passers-by had
                    as they as they neared the stadium was of the backsides of the fans sitting on the Wall watching the games. From
                    that time onwards, the supporters of the ‘Azulgranas’ came to be known in Catalan as ‘Culers’ or ‘Culés’ in
                    Castellano, which means those that show their backsides.

            <h2>Feel Closer to Barca</h2>
            <p>
                Barcelona have developed a unique identity in world football for themselves and it is something that a team can manage
                to do only over a long period of time.
                
                The Blaugranas have their own youth academy known as ‘La Masia’ wherein the children are taught the Barcelona way of
                football which essentially involves a ‘pass and move’ style to keep possession and break down the opposition defence by
                manipulating them and creating space.
                
                This is a style of football used to not just win but to dominate the opponent. The players can learn this style of
                football only in La Masia and this is exactly the reason why one-of-a-kind players like Pep Guardiola, Sergio Busquets
                and the newly found Sergi Samper, can be found only in their academy and they are tailor-made to play it their way.
