        <p>
        This being the first time Barcelona is a true winning club, we are sure to see Barça's fan number go up
        exponentially. With time, some of the new fans will become true Culés in their own right, while others will only
        come on board while the championships continue to arrive at Camp Nou. Both of these already know (or should
        know) a few of Barça's traditions. They have surely seen Messi, Xavi, Iniesta and company show their skills and
        win titles. They have heard El Cant del Barça, even if they might not know what it says. And will most certainly
        know that the Blaugrana considers itself més que un club.
