        This being the first time Barcelona is a true winning club, we are sure to see Barça's fan number go up
        exponentially. With time, some of the new fans will become true Culés in their own right, while others will only
        come on board while the championships continue to arrive at Camp Nou. Both of these already know (or should
        know) a few of Barça's traditions. They have surely seen Messi, Xavi, Iniesta and company show their skills and
        win titles. They have heard El Cant del Barça, even if they might not know what it says. And will most certainly
        know that the Blaugrana considers itself més que un club.

        <h2>You Shall Have No Other Teams Before Barça</h2>
        <p>
            Being a true Barcelona fan (or any other club's, for that matter), is very much like having a religion: you
            just can't have more than one that you like the best.That doesn't mean, however, that you have to be a
            fanatic and hate every other team. What it means is that FC Barcelona will be above any other you might
            like. You can actually appreciate or even like other teams. But none above Barça.
