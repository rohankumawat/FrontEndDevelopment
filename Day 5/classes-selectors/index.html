            his presentation, BarçaTV+ premiere 'Bienvenido, Pedri', a special programme dedicated to getting to know the youngster
            from the Canary Islands. A Barça fan from a young age, Pedri has always stated his joy at receiving his big opportunity.
            In the programme he also took part in a series of games -such as trying to identify players from childhood photos.

            "Right away, from the moment I met my teammates, I've felt really good. Trincao and I, for example, have got on very
            well. Likewise, with Matheus. I am really looking forward to enjoying time with all of my teammates, and learning from
            them."

                Barcelona reject Messi meeting request and stand firm on €700m release clause - Football Espana
            </h1>

            <p class="para1">
                Barcelona will not accept a request from Lionel Messi to hold a meeting with the club to discuss his exit and they will
                only sanction his exit for his €700m release clause, claims Guillem Balague.
                
                Reports in Spain have said Messi wants to meet the Barcelona board to discuss an amicable exit from the club, with the
                player intent on leaving this summer.
                
                The 33-year-old has a clause in his deal allowing him to leave at the end of any season, and whilst it was thought that
                deadline passed in June, Marca have reported his camp believe that it has been extended in line with the prolonged
                2019/20 season.
